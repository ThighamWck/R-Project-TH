In this folder I am doing tests and changes to my turbulence generation.

This is following meeting on Friday 13th June 2025 where Tobias Grafke suggested improvements.

I have fixed up the projection to a divergence-free vector space.

The scaling of wave numbers to fit the Kolmogorov energy cascade is improved, though the aforementioned projection loses energy.

I include some energy spectrum analysis to see how much the projection affects the energy cascade.
